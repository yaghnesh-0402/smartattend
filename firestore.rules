/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the student management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset focuses on allowing public read access to student profiles
 * while restricting write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The application stores student data in the `/students/{studentId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to all student profiles.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) are strictly prohibited.
 *   This ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.
